##Overview
Feng Adapting RED or Self Confugring RED[1] is a variant of RED[2] that makes the RED parameter Pmax adaptive to reduce the packate loss and increase network utilisation in a congested network with variety of traffic.This repository provides the implementation of Feng Adaptive RED in the linux kernel[3].
